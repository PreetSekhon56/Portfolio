imo its a boat, Ahigh flush or nothing, \\n\\nCan you guys please tell me how bad i am for wrecking this hand so i can stop thinking about it.\\n

       "I live in California, and I am a part time student. I've been playing poker since i was a child, and I have been fascinated by it for a while. Online Poker was banned for a while, but now it's allowed. Do you have any website recommendations? I plan on playing small cash games daily.

       "One of my most manageable weaknesses is that when Iâ€™m card-dead, I mentally check out. Game mechanics become a blur because Iâ€™m just expecting to fold pf nearly every hand. It leads to poor results and decision-making when I actually do get hands. For example, I just inexplicably tried to get trappy with pocket aces (limped) when I was facing an opponent who was calling pf raises OOP more than half the time.\\n\\nAnyway, what are some techniques that you use to keep your head in the game?

       "I'll be staying at the Golden Nugget for a week playing in a huge MTT, but in my down time I plan on hitting some poker rooms and other attractions. Besides the typical Vegas Tips like \"don't pay for food/rooms on the Strip\" what advice do you guys have? \\n\\nMy biggest questions are about game selection. When is the best time to hit the poker rooms? I've heard the best rooms are at the Aria and Wynn, and I'll be at the birthplace of modern poker to play cash and tournaments, are there others I should go check out at least once?\\n\\nI know I want to go to the Speedway and drive a supercar around the track, and maybe take a day trip to the Grand Canyon. Any other cool shit to do besides gamble?

       "## 11:47\\n\\nTournament starts in less than 15 minutes.  11 players are registered and there are 3 prizes ($27.50, $16.50, $11.00).  I don't know the skill level of the other players, but I'm pretty sure I'm the greenest entrant.  A tight strategy in the beginning is proably the right way to go until I can figure out how the others play.\\n\\n## 12:00\\n\\nI've been seated.  4 other players at my table.  The blinds are gonna come around really fast.  May need to try and steal them a few times if I want to stay alive.\\n\\n## 12:01\\n\\nFirst hand, I got 46o UTG+1. Fold.\\n\\n## 12:05\\n\\n2 players are AFK at my table, so it's between me and two other players.  famke already went all in twice.\\n\\n## 12:05\\n\\nTT UTG. 2.5BB raise, everyone folds.\\n\\n## 12:06\\n\\nfamke raises to 3BB, I have 55 on the BB.  I call.  Flop is 3K7 all clubs.  That sucks...  famke bets, I'm out.\\n\\n## 12:08\\n\\nA6c, flop came T4A rainbow, Thom bets 90, I raise to 270, he calls.  6 on the turn.  He checks, I bet 500, he folds.\\n\\n## 12:11\\n\\nA8h CU.  Raise to 3BB.  Thom (BB) defends. Flop is K8J.  Thom checks, I bet 1/3 of the pot, he goes all-in.  I fold\\n\\n## 12:13\\n\\nThom raises to 3BB on the button, I defend my big bling with KQo.  Flop comes 9JK.  I bet 2/3 of the bot and take it.  Yay!\\n\\n## 12:14\\n\\nBecause we are only three active players, I play a lot more hands than I normally would (or be comfortable with).  I'm probably seen as a lot looser than I actually want to be.\\n\\n## 12:16\\n\\nNewsflash, famke7 is a **girl**!  On the Internet!!\\n\\n## 12:17\\n\\nHmm, on the BB with A9o and the button makes it 2.5BB to go... Bah, I'll fold\\n\\n## 12:17\\n\\nI love that the player to my left is AFK.  If the action is folded to me in the SB, I can just steal his BB without any danger.  Thom also has an AFK player to his left.\\n\\n## 12:19\\n\\nI like small pocket pairs.  If the flop hits, you bet, otherwise you're pretty much done with the hand.\\n\\n## 12:21\\n\\nAQd in the big blind... and it's folded all around.\\n\\n## 12:22\\n\\nThe action has been pretty passive since famke's all in bets in the first 2 hands.\\n\\n## 12:22\\n\\nPocket tens again.  Betting 2.5BB, called by famke on the button, thom reraises to 300.  Should I call or raise here?  I'll call.  He checks on a 482 flop.  Might have missed with A[KQJ].  I bet 620 (~2/3).  He folds.\\n\\n## 12:25\\n\\nBig hand of our table, famke raises to 4BB in the SB, Thom re-raises all-in, famke calls.  famke turns over ATo and Thom KJo.  Flop comes 2TQ, turn is a 9 for a straight for Thom, river is a meaningless 4.\\n\\n## 12:27\\n\\nI have ATs on the button, raise to 3BB, famke calls, flop comes 8T5.  She checks, I bet 1/3 of the pot, she re-raises to 350.  I'm unsure if she either has a higher pair or hit a set.  Either way, I'm not willing to pay too step of a price to find out.  I'm out.\\n\\n## 12:35\\n\\nBeen a few minutes since we've seen a flop.  First person to raise wins the blinds.\\n\\n## 12:37\\n\\nFinal table!  I'm in the SB with AQo, famke raises 3BB.  Should I call or raise? I raise.  BB folds. Famke calls.  Flop is T7Q.  I'll bet 2/3 of the pot.  I take it down.\\n\\n## 12:38\\n\\nWith 9 players (though only 7 active), I think it's time to tighten up.\\n\\n## 12:42\\n\\nAction is pretty passive right now.  The two AFK players are less than one orbit away from being all-in (and hopefully, eliminated).\\n\\n## 12:45\\n\\nFirst AFK is eliminated by micah67 with sevens full of eights (he had pocket eights)\\n\\n## 12:46\\n\\nAnd the other AFK player is gone.  Chip leader is Oozo with 3,275, short stack is krankt with 890.  I sit at 2,480 at the moment (4 out of 7).\\n\\n## 12:49\\n\\nkrankt is now under 10BB (620, blinds at 40/80).  He goes all in, Thom calls.  AQo for krankt, KK for Thom.  Board is 84944, krankt is eliminated in 7th place.  gg\\n\\n## 12:51\\n\\nThom just too the chip lead when his pocket TT beat micah67's KTs.  micah is now at 995 chips and Thom is at 4,690.\\n\\n## 12:54\\n\\nI'm leaking chips.  I can't find a good spot to steal, and I haven't been dealt a decent hand in a few minutes.  Just now, I had ATs, but when the flop failed to hit me and famke bet the size of the pot (700), I had to fold.\\n\\n## 12:55\\n\\nBreak time.\\n\\n## 13:00\\n\\nWe're back, and I have K8s in the big blind.  Should I defend?  For now, I choose no and fold to a 3BB bet from famke on the button.\\n\\n## 13:01\\n\\nOh, big pot!  famke raised to 3BB, micah in the BB went all in and got called.  He showed A9o and famke showed JTs.  Board came 22A28 and micah was saved with a full house.  I'm glad I didn't call from the SB with KJo, although I'm gonna need to find a spot real soon.\\n\\n\\n## 13:03\\n\\nYeah, that wasn't my spot.  KTs, I thought I'd try to steal the blinds, but that back fired when Sharif called my bet a re-raised my continuation bet.  I'm down to 11 big blinds.  The end is near...\\n\\n## 13:05\\n\\nThird KT in a row that I've picked up... the poker gods are trying to tell me something, but what?\\n\\n## 13:06\\n\\nmicah opened with a 3BB bet from UTG+1 and got called by Sharif and Thom.  Flop came T88 with two clubs and it was checked all around.  Turn was Jc, Thom bet 300 and was called by micah and Sharif folded.  Pot is 1550, micah as 1540 left.  Turn is 6h.  Thom bets 1000, micah waits a few moments and goes all in.  Thom insta calls and shows 89s for trip 8s.  micah had AJ for two pairs.  micah is eliminated in 6th place. gg\\n\\n## 13:10\\n\\nStill working on staying alive.  I managed to steal the blinds a couple times while I was writing the previous paragraph, but I'm still at 10BB.\\n\\n## 13:11\\n\\nWOOT! Black aces!  I raise to 3BB and get one caller (Thom).  Flop comes AQ3, and I'm ecstatic.  He bets 480, I just call.  Turn is the 9d.  He checks, I go all in, he calls.  He shows AT.  River is a deuce, I take a 2650 chip pot and can breathe easier.\\n\\n## 13:15\\n\\nPlaying and keeping a log at the same time is pretty hard.  If someone wanted to do this, they should get a microphone.\\n\\n## 13:16\\n\\nOozo remarked that it's become pretty serious at the table.  With only two eliminations before money prizes are awarded, it's understandable.  I wonder if I can make it?  With a good chunk of luck, I guess I could (I don't think I have the skills to outplay them).\\n\\n## 13:19\\n\\nWith A2s on the button, I raised 3 times the big blind and got called by Sharif.  Flop came 9J8 and he checked.  I bet half the pot, and he went all in.  I folded and he graciously showed a set of 9s.  I avoided elimination, but I'm down to 1100 chips.\\n\\n## 13:21\\n\\nI got AK and AQ, went all in with them and won the blinds.  I'm still alive.\\n\\n## 13:22\\n\\nKT in the SB with less than 10BB.  All-in.  Sharif folds.\\n\\n## 13:23\\n\\nI had A4o on the button with less than 10BB.  Should I go all-in, or is there too big a chance of being dominated by someone else with an ace?\\n\\n## 13:24\\n\\nfamke (big stack) puts 640 in the pot from UTG.  I have A8o on the button and a desperate need for chips.  I fold nonetheless.\\n\\n## 13:25\\n\\nBig pot between Sharif and famke.  Sharif opened with a 3BB raise, famke went all in and Sharif called.  He showed JJ and she had AK of hearts.  The flop was 747 with two hearts, a 3 came on the turn and a J on the river.  Sharif wins with a full house.\\n\\n## 13:27\\n\\nI'm on the button with pocket eights.  I move all in and get called by Oozo on the BB.  He shows pocket threes.  The board comes 69K7Q and I double up.\\n\\n## 13:28\\n\\nThe blinds are now at 100/200.  I have 2500 chips, Oozo has 1100.  We're still desperate.\\n\\n## 13:29\\n\\nI've gotten QQ twice in the last couple of minutes, but everybody ran away from my raises.\\n\\n## 13:30\\n\\nI have ATo in middle position, I open to 3BB Oozo goes all-in for 1,320 and I call.  He shows AQo.  The board comes KT526, I suck out and Oozo is eliminated in 5th place. GG!  Also, I am no longer the short stack, famke is.  Can I somehow squeeze myself into the money?\\n\\n## 13:33\\n\\nThom opens by just calling the big blind.  I raise to 3BB with AQo and he goes all-in.  I fold.  He says he'll tell me what he had after the tournament.  I'm putting him on JJ and above, trying to lure someone with a lesser hand into the pot.\\n\\n## 13:36\\n\\nHoly shmoly!  After winning a sizeable pot against Thom, I'm now second in chip!\\n\\n## 13:38\\n\\nNo one wants to be the bubble boy (or gal in famke's case).  famke is being very aggressive in stealing the blinds and antes.  She's won the last 7-8 hands without any opposition.\\n\\n## 13:42\\n\\nThom (UTG) calls the big blind, I raise to 4BB with QQ, Sharif and famke gold, Thom goes all in and I call.  He shows AQo.  Flop comes A5K.  Ouch!  I need the last queen!  Turn is a 9, river is a T, Thom wins the pot and I have 95 chips left.  Next hand I have 87o, I call all-in.  The board is A6572 with three diamonds.  Famke and Thom were in the pot too.  Famke (J6d) shows a flush, Thom (A2) made aces and deuces and I am the bubble boy.\\n\\n\\nSince lunch is served, I'll have to stop reporting the action.  Good game everyone, it's been really fun!\\n       1\n",
