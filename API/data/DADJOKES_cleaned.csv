so the other weekend we were out geocaching (i'd explain but easier to google if you don't know what it is). basically a gps scavenger hunt.

so the directions to find this item said that if you take the wrong path you will have to do some bush whacking  to get where you need to be.

my daughter said i don't like bush whacking dad let's try the other trail.

i responded: being your guy you should get used to bush whacking.

my daughter just rolled her eyes and groaned as she said that was a really bad dad joke.

meanwhile her friend that was with us (i think they dating but won't admit it to me) just dropped to her knees and damn near bust a gut in laughter.

so i will take the win.

edit: what made this even better is throughout the day her friend kept laughing randomly and when my daughter asked what was so funny? they simply replied:  bush whacking.  my daughter's groans continued to be more pronounced everytime she did this.

the icing on the cake was when i asked what sounded good for dinner?  my daughter suggested taco bell. her friend said ""can we go to outback steak house......... i hear they have a bush whacker special?""

the lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game. the blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. the lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun.

he says, ""i ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me five dollars, and vice versa.""

again, she declines and tries to get some sleep.

the lawyer, now agitated, says, ""okay, if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and if i don't know the answer, i will pay you $500.""

this catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment, agrees to the game.

the lawyer asks the first question: ""what's the distance from the earth to the moon?""

the blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill, and hands it to the lawyer.

""okay,"" says the lawyer, ""your turn.""

she asks, ""what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?""

the lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references ... no answer. he taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the internet and the library of congress ... no answer. frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers but to no avail.

after an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $500.

the blonde thanks him and turns back to get some more sleep.

3344,"how did the vikings come to be called norwegians? people ask me sometimes, they say ( because they are wise to seek my counsel on this matter), ""how is it that norsemen came to be known as ""norwegians""?""

you see, back in days of yore, when norsemen first got it in their heads that the brits and the picts were a puny lot, ripe for the harvest so to speak, they first scouted the area by pretending to be tourists.  they found themselves a nice sidewalk cafe operated by a couple limey weasels, and set their boots heavily on the outdoor table and ordered up a corned beast suitable to their needs.  and ale.  they needed some ale.  you can't smash a horn down and demand ""more ale, wench!"" in a loud, commanding voice if you haven't had any in the first place.

the waitress was a slip of a lass, dark-complected,   demure and quiet to match her appearance.  she stammered out that, being a green initiative business, ale was not only unavailable but philosophically out of place.  but they had some lovely tea with a hint of lavender...

thorrfin skullsplitter leaned forward at this news, and bellowed, ""we are not teetotalers!"", pounding his fist on the iron-lace table.

lenny mcgreasel, one of the cafe's two owners, heard the commotion and injected his condescending, servile whine to the conversation, ""is there anything we can bring the large gentlemen from our menu?"", gesticulating to the hand-crafted hemp/flaxseed menu depicting what could 
only be described as a garden, rather than a list of things to eat.

thorrfin's  mate, snorri log-bender, immediately ordered, as if he'd been thinking about this moment for some time, ""what i'd like is to have some bacon salad""

thorrfin was still muttering in his beard over not being a teetotaler.  "" i'm sorry sir, we only serve as food that which has grown fresh from the garden""' the waitress  chirped.  that was the last straw.  with a shove of his boot, and a full dose of disgust, the table flew backwards.

""c'mon, snorri"", he said in disgust, and he stood, once again emoting, ""we are not teetotalers""

just then another small-faced waitress popped around the corner carrying tofu laced with kale and and whole-grain brown rice.  snorri saw his chance, and with a face of disgust he emoted, 

""nor vegans""

and with that they bid  their their host a hostile farewell, only to return two weekends later with a fully armed force of vikings,- and established what would become the preeminent fast food of a millennia, fish and chips, served only with the darkest stout.

to hear the english say it, you'd think now it had been their idea all along.

it's been an evening, and they get to his 9th symphony. it's a longer piece, and there's this whole movement where it's all percussion and wind instruments. the bassists leave the stage, and two cellists also step away. no big deal. the cellists apparently went back to the conductor's dressing room and began having sex, which i think is just awesome. the bassists went to the green room and started drinking. they knew how long they had. when one of the younger guys noticed the time almost up, an older one stopped him, and let him know that he threaded the score pages together, forcing the conductor to vamp and cover while he opened the rest of the score. that gives them a bit more time. when they get back to the stage, they're really drunk. the cellists still haven't returned. the conductor is frantically trying to undo his score while maintaining the piece. i'm watching this all, gleefully. it's the best concert i ever saw. my wife is a bit frustrated though, and whispers to me ""why are you so pleased?""

3559,"i have always been a man of principle, which makes it really hard for me to keep a steady relationship. a few years back, after a series of unsuccessful relationships, i finally met the girl of my dreams. it wasn't your regular love at first sight hollywood movie script. we met during one of my business trips and shared a table at lunch, but nothing suggested we would be keeping in touch for the coming months. during one of our conversations, i even jokingly mentioned that if we ever got married, i would let her plan out every single detail of our wedding day, since i was not expecting our friendship or even potential relationship to last too long.

several hundred roses, a dozen dates and one engagement ring later, i somehow found myself on the brink of getting married to the smartest, most beautiful and kind woman i had ever met. although i had a couple of ideas for our wedding day, being the man of principle i am, i had no intention of breaking the promise i had made to her all that time ago about her having her way if we ever ended up getting married. luckily for me, she didn't have all that many requests. pretty much the only thing she had figured out years before we even met was her getting married on december 31st. she had this whole idea of marrying her husband on new year's eve and giving a new meaning to the saying ""new year, new me"".

the big day finally came, and there are no words to describe what i felt watching her walk down the aisle. the ceremony was emotional and heartfelt, and all seemed to be just perfect up to the point where the pastor took his sweet time to deliver his speech. we had planned for the first kiss to come right before the stroke of midnight, but when he was finally done, it was already january 1st. he said i could kiss the bride, but i refused. needless to say, it completely ruined the wedding and my newlywed wife filed for divorce on the same day.

the man explained that he wanted to get a mural of custers last stand and the painter said that he could take care of it…no problem. since he was the only one to answer the ad the man decided to go with this painter.
 “one thing”, he said, “i’m gonna have to leave for a week while you do the painting. is that gonna be a problem? “the painter says “no man won’t be a problem at all i’ll take care of it.”
the man returns a week later and as he walks in his house from vacation he sees the mural on his wall and is immediately aggravated. 
the mural has beautiful green rolling hills. on the crest of the hill on the left is a holstein cow, standing on her back legs with one hoof over her eyes as if to shade her sight from the sun. a glowing halo is above the cows head. 
in the valley on the right there is a large cotton field filled with people with white cotton bags over their shoulders. the man looks closely at the people thinking that they are slaves from the pre-civil war south, but realizes that they are instead native americans, or indians…and they are harvesting cotton. 
he is now fuming mad and just then the painter shows up to get paid. they start arguing and the man says “i asked for custer’s last stand!  what is this crap?”

6, filled with fury, called his friends 2 and 4. they would get even. 10 was the best friend of 7 you see. 2, 4 and 6 ate 10 to get even. they then began plotting further revenge, but 7 acted first. he gathered 1, 3 and 5 together to take down 6.

realizing that the odds were against them, 2, 4 and 6 retreated. their only option was to turn to 12 who had twice the resources 6 had. 7 couldn't follow.

12 quickly called 3 to find out what the root of 7's attack on 9. 3 wasn't sure. he had only supported 7 because of a long standing friendship. but 3 promised to get to the root cause.

meanwhile, 7's scheming was not yet done. 12 was powerful, but there was one who could reverse his decision to harbor 6. if he could just convince 21, nicknamed blackjack, to reverse 12's decision, it would all be over.

three times 7 went to 21's compound. on the third try he was able to get through. after explaining that 6 had masterminded the elimination of 10, a grand meeting of the numbers was called.

both 6 and 7 argued over the whole thing. 13 had the unlucky task of adjudicating the meeting. each time 13 made an argument, 6 and 7 would add to it by shouting over each other.

finally, 21 had had enough. ""7, why did you eat 9""

7 responded ""i just wanted to get 3 square meals."" 21 had 7 eliminated for initiating the battle and 6 jailed for masterminding 10's death. and the war was over.",dadjokes

4954,"there once was a pirate named thatch. every weekend, after a week of looting he would visit the local pub, the white hart. after drinking to his 'hart's content', him and his crew would slowly saunter back to their ship. but everytime at the exact same spot, he would turn to his crew and say. ""boys, i need a moment alone"". 

he would then go into a small, broken path into the woods. non dared to follow and risk incurring his wrath. consequently  speculations flowed as plentifully as wine, some saying that he had a stash of hidden treasure, some beliveing that he was searching for a witch doctor. many went to the location when the captain wasn't there, but found nothing. 
finally a day came, when one crew member, either inflated by a false sense of bravado after a particularly succesful raid or just drunk beyond his senses, decided to follow the captain. 
the crew member, edwin had made up his mind. he stealthily followed the drunk captain, careful to keep out of sight.

 the captain followed the path, for a few minutes but suddenly, at a big stone, deviated from it. edwin could feel the anticipation rise. he was so close to finally solving the mystery. he followed slowly behind and found himself in a clearing. the first thing he noticed was a large gravestone. the writing on it had been completely eroded and he could not make out any words. wondering if this was someone the captain paid respects too, he tried to inch closer to get a better look. he could make out the captain's silhouette, facing away from him, into the brush. he was crawling forward when  he heard a light pitter patter. in his confusion, forgetting that he wasn't supposed to be there he blurted out ""captain, are you urinating?"" 
the captain slowly turned around, lightly startled. ""oh, hello edwin."" the captain followed edwins gaze and looked at the gravestone. he nodded solemnly. ""arr, i pee""",dadjokes

5557,"dad jokes...on him  

my father is fond of jokes and pranks (even though i only pretend to laugh .-.) but there's this story that i always would genuinely laugh at whenever it is brought up. so here it goes...

we've always gone to church every sunday when we were kids and on one of those sundays, my father decided to make my mother laugh by shaving only half of his beard. so while the other side has hair, the other is shaved. he casually walked up to my mother and asked if he looked good in his ""new fashion style."" my mother laughed so hard she couldn't breathe.

when that was over, we got ourselves ready and went to church. while praying, there was a bunch of people looking at my father. he noticed that as soon as he looked at those people, they'd cover their face, bow their heads and walk away. he felt weird. so he got into this 'thinking position' where he had his hands to play with his beard. and that's when he realized...he forgot to shave the other half at home and no one noticed until we got there. hahahhahaha he was so embarassed, he covered his whole face until mass was over.

that's all folks. thank you for coming to my dad talks .",dadjokes

the first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. the night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. 

the second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. the night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. 

the third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. the night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight’s armor. 

the next day, the battle began. all the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. the squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. so, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. 

the battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. the lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. 

and it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",dadjokes

i was around 9 years old and i was in the cub scouts, and it was box car derby season. i was in the dining room, carving away at my block of wood when the blade in my right hand skipped the wood and carved my left thumb. it fucking hurt and bled like a sonofabitch. i immediately starting screaming and my dad raced into the room and found me covered in blood, my left hand now with two thumbs. we get it wrapped and he drives me to the emergency room. by the time we got there the bleeding had stopped and i have stopped crying. as we pull up, my dad looks st me, shakes his head and says ""we can't go in there like this, we'll end up waiting forever to see a doctor. you need to cry once we're in there and that'll help""
i said ok, and he said as we were walking up, ""i'll give you a signal to start crying."" how will i know, i asked him snd he just said i'll know. we go inside and walk up to the admittance desk. i'm short, so at the time my head just cleared the desk. my dad tells the nurse that we have a cut, and need to see a doctor right away. the nurse pushes paperwork at him and he tells her again, this time that its a real bad cut. the nurse finally looks at me for the first time and she frowns, because im relatively normal looking, even though im hurting and nervous, waiting for my dads signal. my dad pulls me back a bit and her eyes widen really big when she sees all the dried blood  caked on the lower left side of my body. she starts getting excited and says ""ohmygoshohmygosh"" over and over and this point im starting to get scared when my dad, in a serious voice says ""its even worse than it looks! you're going to have to take the whole hand!""

then i start crying.

yesterday i was travelling.  when i visited the restroom prior to boarding my flight, the the music in my head suddenly switched tracks from ""i've been everywhere man"" (that got really old after the first hour. oy!) to ""africa"" by toto. ""that's odd"", i thought to myself, ""the music in my head usually doesn't switch tracks unless something has changed around me.""  i finished my business, cleaned up, stood up, and turned around to flush.

then i saw it.  there, emblazoned on the porcelain, was the word ""toto"".  the manufacturer of the toilet.  ""nice job, brain, funny, hah-hah,"" i thought to myself. 

the song in my head came to an abrupt halt. silence, for just one moment. blessed silence. rare for me.  then i realized. my brain was giving me time to digest the previous joke. waiting for me to think i'd arrived at the punch line.  pausing for a beat before it delivered the next one.

""dad you have to understand, i can't control it. i can't stop killing. there's a hunger deep within me. it wakes me up at night telling me to kill. i'm always hungry, i'm always craving new flesh. i try to turn it off, but it keeps coming back. dad, please help me. i'm hungry....""

at this point i have to say that there are spoilers, somewhat major, so i apologize to those who plan on seeing the movie.

so around an hour or so in, the main protagonist gets to the ship and takes of her spacesuit and such. she's moseying around in the ship for a while, when there's the second round of shrapnel from the russian missle hurdling at her ship. she jumps in the escape pod and tries to gtfo, but the parachute is stuck on the main body of the iss. she puts on the spacesuit inside the ship and goes to unscrew the parachute. since, according to my father, she's wearing a russian spacesuit, he blurts out

""oh, well now she's russian!""

everyone was silent for a minute, which was broken by him following up with

""because of that shrapnel!""

no one really knew what he was talking about, so he had to explain, that she was wearing a russian suit and was rushing because of that shrapnel.

he got a few chuckles, but it appeared he was in deep thought. we finished up the movie and went to bed.

the next morning, we were having breakfast together and he said 

""if you're american in the kitchen, and german in the family room, then what are you in the bathroom?""

i replied with,""european"", and i figured he was just repeating one of his old jokes, but he then said,
